-LISS-

The variable names differ between waves starting from the letter 'a' and the year of the first survey, in this case '08'

So the age of the respondent in Wave 1 of the Family and Household data is cf08a004, but is written below as '004' as the name changes for each wave 
and the prefix changes for each of the sub-questionnaires so for Work and Schooling the age of the respondent in Wave 1 is named 'cw08a004',
but the number (three last digits) of the variable (question) remains the same across waves.
